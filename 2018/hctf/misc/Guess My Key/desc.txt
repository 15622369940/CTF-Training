Description 
Here is a simple encryption system, you can treat it as a function: 
C = F_enc(P, K)

where C is the ciphertext, P is the plaintext, K is the key you have to figure out what it is. 
The specific mapping rules of F_enc is automatically learned by machine learning tricks (So I don't know what it actually is in fact). 
The provided API "/enc?msg=xxx&key=xxx", will expose some information of this mapping rules to you, you have to make full use of these clues and find out what the REAL_KEY is (you can replace it with your own key but you cannot read it directly). 
P.S. You should wrap the correctly converted REAL_KEY with "hctf{" and "}" manually.
